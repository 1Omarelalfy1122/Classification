## Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine gender based on given data. It demonstrates end-to-end workflow: data processing, model training, validation, and inference.  

Use cases include: data analytics, demographic studies, or enhancements in user profiling (with ethical considerations in mind).

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Multiple classification algorithms  
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
- Easy inference / prediction pipeline  

---

## Dataset

- Source: [describe where dataset comes from, or include sample size, features]  
- Features used: e.g. name, length of name, character features / image features / etc.  
- Train / test split: e.g. 80/20 or cross-validation  

---

## Model

- Algorithms tried (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Selected model & hyperparameters  
- Any issues encountered (overfitting, class imbalance, etc.)
