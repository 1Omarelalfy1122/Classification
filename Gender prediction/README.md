## 🔍 Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Analyzed dataset distributions and feature correlations.  
   - Visualized relationships between features and target variable.  

2. Preprocessing  
   - Handled missing values.  
   - Encoded categorical variables.  
   - Scaled numerical features where necessary.  

3. Modeling  
   - Implemented multiple classification models, such as:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Random Forest  

4. Evaluation  
   - Evaluated models using metrics:  
     - Accuracy  
     - Precision  
     - Recall  
     - F1-score  
   - Confusion matrices were generated for better error analysis.

## 📊 Results
- Built and compared multiple models to classify gender.  
- Tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest) provided the best performance.  
- Feature importance analysis highlighted the most predictive features in the dataset.
